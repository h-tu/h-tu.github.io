End of Fall 2021 semester update: 

For my COMP SCI 682 final project, I made a program that plays the computer game "crossy road" by itself using Computer Vision and Reinforcement learning. 

Paper can be found here: [682 Paper](https://github.com/h-tu/course_reports/blob/main/cs682/682_Final_Paper.pdf).
