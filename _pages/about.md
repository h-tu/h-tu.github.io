End of Fall 2021 semester update: 

For my COMP SCI 682 final project, I made a program that plays the computer game [crossy road](https://www.crossyroad.com/) using Computer Vision and Reinforcement learning. ([Playing Arcade Game with Object Recognition and Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/h-tu/course_reports/blob/main/grad_projects/682_Final_Paper.pdf))

Here is a visual demo:
