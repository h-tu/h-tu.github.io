[cite_start]I am a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in computer vision and reinforcement learning[cite: 14, 19, 41, 42].

[cite_start]Since graduating, I have been working in the industry, where my research focuses on applying deep learning to solve real-world perception challenges[cite: 19]. [cite_start]This role involves developing and optimizing algorithms for tasks like autonomous navigation and multi-sensor fusion[cite: 19, 20].

[cite_start]I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst [cite: 4, 5][cite_start], where my studies were centered on Ph.D.-level coursework in areas like Reinforcement Learning and advanced Deep Learning[cite: 14]. [cite_start]I also hold a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Maryland[cite: 6, 7]. [cite_start]A highlight of my graduate work was a collaboration with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, which resulted in a first-author publication at a NeurIPS 2022 workshop[cite: 47].

### News & Personal Projects

* **(In Development) JellyCATalog iOS App:** As a personal project, I am developing an iOS app called [JellyCATalog](https://jellycatalog.github.io/), which is currently in public beta. The app helps users catalog and manage their collections.
* **(Nov 2023) AR Guitar Assistant:** I developed a prototype for an augmented reality application to assist guitar players. More details are available on my [side projects](https://h-tu.github.io/side_project/) page.

### Featured Professional Project: Real-Time Visual SLAM

[cite_start]In my current role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I am developing a high-performance Visual SLAM system for autonomous navigation[cite: 16, 19]. [cite_start]This project involves creating and optimizing deep learning pipelines for feature extraction and matching, enhanced by multi-sensor fusion to ensure robust performance in real-world conditions[cite: 19, 20].

### Featured Academic Project: Autonomous Gaming Agent

[cite_start]As a project at UMass Amherst, I developed an autonomous agent to play the game *Crossy Road*[cite: 37, 39]. [cite_start]The system uses a custom-trained YOLO model for real-time object detection and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for control, which was trained on over 100 hours of gameplay data[cite: 40, 41].
