- I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Software Developer. My research focuses are: ML, (Deep) Reinforcement Learning, Perception. 
- I went to University of Maryland from 2017 to 2021 for BS in Computer Engineering with an upper-level concentration in machine learning
- During my MSCS studies at University of Massachusetts Amherst, out of 10 [courses](https://h-tu.github.io/courses/), I completed 8 in PhD level, each with a final project.

### News & Personal Projects

* **(In Development) JellyCATalog iOS App:** As a personal project, I am developing an iOS app called [JellyCATalog](https://jellycatalog.github.io/), which is currently in public beta. The app helps users catalog and manage their collections.
* **(Nov 2023) AR Guitar Assistant:** I developed a prototype for an augmented reality application to assist guitar players. More details are available on my [side projects](https://h-tu.github.io/side_project/) page.

### Featured Professional Project: Real-Time Visual SLAM

In my current role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I am developing a high-performance Visual SLAM system for autonomous navigation. This project involves creating and optimizing deep learning pipelines for feature extraction and matching, enhanced by multi-sensor fusion to ensure robust performance in real-world conditions.

### Featured Academic Project: Autonomous Gaming Agent

As a course project at UMass Amherst, I developed an autonomous agent to play the game *Crossy Road*. The system uses a custom-trained YOLO model for real-time object detection and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for control, which was trained on over 100 hours of gameplay data.
