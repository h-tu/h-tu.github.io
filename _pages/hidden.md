I have always dreamed of building next-generation, general-purpose robots since high school. That’s why I chose to complete my bachelor’s degree at the University of Maryland, majoring in computer engineering. During my four years at UMD, I participated in multiple research programs and took courses across mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science departments, which allowed me to build a solid theoretical (mathematical) foundation and engineering mindset, as well as communication and collaboration skills with students and faculty from diverse cultural backgrounds.

To deepen my understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which I had developed a strong interest in, I decided to continue my education through a master’s program in computer science at UMass Amherst. Driven by a desire to pursue excellence, I chose to take 8 out of the 10 courses at the PhD level, each involving a final thesis project. Through diverse courses like Advanced NLP, Information Retrieval, and ML for CV/CG that emphasized practical applications, as well as Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Numerical Optimization that were more theory-based, I developed a broad and deep understanding of machine learning — not only how it works, but also why.

During graduate school, I worked with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and published our work as first author at NeurIPS 2022, where we applied machine learning to solve the retrosynthesis problem in organic chemistry. I believe this work perfectly showcases my interest in applying machine learning to real-world, cross-disciplinary problems, my curiosity, and my ability to quickly adapt to unfamiliar subjects.

After nearly two years in industrial research roles, the challenges I faced sharpened my skills and confirmed my determination to continue my academic journey through a PhD program. The Shenzhen Loop Program seems to be a perfect fit, where I can leverage my experience studying and working in the U.S. for the past eight years while returning home to make a meaningful contribution.

In summary, I believe my solid theoretical foundation, wide range of hands-on experience, curiosity as an engineer, and deep passion for robotics put me in a strong position for this program. I am confident I can make meaningful contributions, and I am more than excited by this opportunity.
