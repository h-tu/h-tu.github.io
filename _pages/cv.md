Education
======
* University of Massachusetts, Amherst
  * M.S. in Computer Science
  * Aug. 2021 - May 2023 (Expected)
* University of Maryland, College Park
  * B.S. in Computer Engineering
  * Aug. 2017 - May 2021 

Experience
======
* Fall 2020: Undergraduate Research
  * University of Maryland
  * Proposed to use the robot arm to interact with objects to maximize the perception of the object during object identification, especially, recover the lost information caused by objects concealed by each other.
  * Conducted the simulation experiments with the ML_Agents library of the Unity game engine.
  * Participated in the reinforcement learning training of the mechanical arm in the virtual environment by setting up virtual environment, adjusting the setting parameters, reward and penalty, etc.
  
* Winter 2019: Recommender System Optimization Specialist Intern
  * Tencent, News Feed Platform Department 
  * Participated in optimizing the recommendation engine for Tencent ‘Kandian’, a new content service for info stream, predicting the view counts with just the title of an article, finding keywords that effects view counts the most and acquiring trending topics up to date.
  * Improved the System with machine learning techniques, including dimension reduction, TFIDF and n-gram.

* Summer 2019: Security Engineer Intern
  * Shanghai Huifu Payment Ltd., Product Control Department
  * Used the open source toolkit “chaos blade” developed by Alibaba to test the wholeness of system security under extreme circumstances related to full load of RAM, CPU, disk storage and so on.

* Fall 2017: FIRE Program, Machine Learning stream
  * University of Maryland
  * Aimed to build a mode with triplet network to detect individual bats’ call within a specific species, which could aid the revival of endangered species such as the Mexican Fishing Bats by providing a greater understanding of the behavior and speech patterns of the individuals that make up a species.
  * Imported pre-processed spectrograms into our model and combined a triplet network specific to images with a
residual network to improve the detection accuracy.
  * Proved that a triplet loss network is efficient and feasible to calculate the loss between input data.

Selected Courseworks
======
* Course Project for COMP SCI 685: Advanced Natural Language Processing - May. 2022
  * Scraped over 1 million Danmu (live comments) from a Chinese video site Bilibili.
  * Proposed to extract in-jokes that are popular within different categories of videos from the 1 million text-based comments, and used GAN to generate Danmu that fits specified video categories. 
  * Performed fine-tuning to BERT so that it learns to predict the origin category of certain in-jokes. 


* Course Project for COMP SCI 682: Neural Networks: Modern Intro - Nov. 2021
  * Applied a mix of technics in computer vision and reinforcement learning to play arcade game.
  * Trained three neural networks to control the player in the game: first uses YOLO to extract features from the game visual. Its output will go through processing and  be turned into state representations and feed into RL model and actions that will yield the highest reward will be outputted. Last model acts as a wrapper that will turn the game into a trainable environment. 

* Course Project for COMP SCI 687: Reinforcement Learning - Nov. 2021
  * Implemented Reinforce with Baseline, One-Step Actor-Critic, Episodic Semi-Gradient n-step SARSA with PyTorch. 
  * Constructed Environments including Grid World, Mountain Car, Cartpole and Blackjack and applied the three algorithms above to the environments to compare the performances. 

* Course Project for CMSC426: Computer Vision - May 2021
  * Made a tool to stitch images into a panorama using SIFT, Homography Estimation, Image Warping (Blending), etc.
  * Implemented 16-layer CNN with PyTorch for image classification for another task.

* Course Project for CMSC320: Intro to Data Science - May 2020
  * Applied Machine Learning Algorithm, logistic regression classifier to predict NBA Games.
  * Conducted analysis of the relationships between the winning and field-goal, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnover, etc. Coded with Python.

* Course Project for CMSC421: Intro to AI - Dec. 2019
  * Built a basic neural network from scratch with the mathematical principles learnt in class.
  * Implemented functions including feed forward, training and backpropagate. Coded with Python.
